This module defines utilities to manipulate HTML.

Convert the characters & , < and > in string s to HTML-safe sequences.  Use this if you need to display text that might contain such characters in HTML.  If the optional flag quote is true, the characters ( " ) and ( ' ) are also translated; this helps for inclusion in an HTML attribute value delimited by quotes, as in <a href="..."> .

Added in version 3.2.

Convert all named and numeric character references (e.g. > , > , > ) in the string s to the corresponding Unicode characters.  This function uses the rules defined by the HTML 5 standard for both valid and invalid character references, and the list of HTML 5 named character references .

Added in version 3.4.
