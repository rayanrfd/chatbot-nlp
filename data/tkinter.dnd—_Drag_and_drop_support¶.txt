Source code: Lib/tkinter/dnd.py

Note

This is experimental and due to be deprecated when it is replaced with the Tk DND.

The tkinter.dnd module provides drag-and-drop support for objects within a single application, within the same window or between windows. To enable an object to be dragged, you must create an event binding for it that starts the drag-and-drop process. Typically, you bind a ButtonPress event to a callback function that you write (see Bindings and Events ). The function should call dnd_start() , where 'source' is the object to be dragged, and 'event' is the event that invoked the call (the argument to your callback function).

Selection of a target object occurs as follows:

Top-down search of area under mouse for target widget

Top-down search of area under mouse for target widget

Target widget should have a callable dnd_accept attribute

Target widget should have a callable dnd_accept attribute

If dnd_accept is not present or returns None , search moves to parent widget

If dnd_accept is not present or returns None , search moves to parent widget

If no target widget is found, then the target object is None

If no target widget is found, then the target object is None

Call to <old_target>.dnd_leave(source, event)

Call to <old_target>.dnd_leave(source, event)

Call to <new_target>.dnd_enter(source, event)

Call to <new_target>.dnd_enter(source, event)

Call to <target>.dnd_commit(source, event) to notify of drop

Call to <target>.dnd_commit(source, event) to notify of drop

Call to <source>.dnd_end(target, event) to signal end of drag-and-drop

Call to <source>.dnd_end(target, event) to signal end of drag-and-drop

The DndHandler class handles drag-and-drop events tracking Motion and ButtonRelease events on the root of the event widget.

Cancel the drag-and-drop process.

Execute end of drag-and-drop functions.

Inspect area below mouse for target objects while drag is performed.

Signal end of drag when the release pattern is triggered.

Factory function for drag-and-drop process.
