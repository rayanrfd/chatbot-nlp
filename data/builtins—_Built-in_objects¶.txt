This module provides direct access to all 'built-in' identifiers of Python; for example, builtins.open is the full name for the built-in function open() .

This module is not normally accessed explicitly by most applications, but can be useful in modules that provide objects with the same name as a built-in value, but in which the built-in of that name is also needed.  For example, in a module that wants to implement an open() function that wraps the built-in open() , this module can be used directly:

import builtins def open ( path ): f = builtins . open ( path , 'r' ) return UpperCaser ( f ) class UpperCaser : '''Wrapper around a file that converts output to uppercase.''' def __init__ ( self , f ): self . _f = f def read ( self , count =- 1 ): return self . _f . read ( count ) . upper () # ...

As an implementation detail, most modules have the name __builtins__ made available as part of their globals.  The value of __builtins__ is normally either this module or the value of this module's __dict__ attribute. Since this is an implementation detail, it may not be used by alternate implementations of Python.
