errno — Standard errno system symbols

|

Theme Auto Light Dark |

This module makes available standard errno system symbols. The value of each symbol is the corresponding integer value. The names and descriptions are borrowed from linux/include/errno.h , which should be all-inclusive.

Dictionary providing a mapping from the errno value to the string name in the underlying system.  For instance, errno.errorcode[errno.EPERM] maps to 'EPERM' .

To translate a numeric error code to an error message, use os.strerror() .

Of the following list, symbols that are not used on the current platform are not defined by the module.  The specific list of defined symbols is available as errno.errorcode.keys() .  Symbols available can include:

Operation not permitted. This error is mapped to the exception PermissionError .
