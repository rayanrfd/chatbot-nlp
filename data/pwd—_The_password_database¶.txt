pwd — The password database

|

Theme Auto Light Dark |

This module provides access to the Unix user account and password database.  It is available on all Unix versions.

Availability : Unix, not WASI, not iOS.

Password database entries are reported as a tuple-like object, whose attributes correspond to the members of the passwd structure (Attribute field below, see <pwd.h> ):

Meaning

0

pw_name

Login name

1

pw_passwd

Optional encrypted password

pw_gecos

User name or comment field

5

pw_dir

User home directory

6

pw_shell

User command interpreter

The uid and gid items are integers, all others are strings. KeyError is raised if the entry asked for cannot be found.

Note

In traditional Unix the field pw_passwd usually contains a password encrypted with a DES derived algorithm.  However most modern unices  use a so-called shadow password system.  On those unices the pw_passwd field only contains an asterisk ( '*' ) or the  letter 'x' where the encrypted password is stored in a file /etc/shadow which is not world readable.  Whether the pw_passwd field contains anything useful is system-dependent.

It defines the following items:

Return the password database entry for the given numeric user ID.

Return the password database entry for the given user name.

Return a list of all available password database entries, in arbitrary order.
