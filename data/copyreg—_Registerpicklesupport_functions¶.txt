The copyreg module offers a way to define functions used while pickling specific objects.  The pickle and copy modules use those functions when pickling/copying those objects.  The module provides configuration information about object constructors which are not classes. Such constructors may be factory functions or class instances.

Declares object to be a valid constructor.  If object is not callable (and hence not valid as a constructor), raises TypeError .

Declares that function should be used as a "reduction" function for objects of type type . function must return either a string or a tuple containing between two and six elements. See the dispatch_table for more details on the interface of function .

The constructor_ob parameter is a legacy feature and is now ignored, but if passed it must be a callable.

Note that the dispatch_table attribute of a pickler object or subclass of pickle.Pickler can also be used for declaring reduction functions.

The example below would like to show how to register a pickle function and how it will be used:

>>> import copyreg , copy , pickle >>> class C : ... def __init__ ( self , a ): ... self . a = a ... >>> def pickle_c ( c ): ... print ( "pickling a C instance..." ) ... return C , ( c . a ,) ... >>> copyreg . pickle ( C , pickle_c ) >>> c = C ( 1 ) >>> d = copy . copy ( c ) pickling a C instance... >>> p = pickle . dumps ( c ) pickling a C instance...
